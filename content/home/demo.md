Welcome! The Chinese-American Lung Association (CALA) is an independent and non-profit organization founded by a group of Chinese-American pulmonary scientists and physicians in 2012. CALA is to serve as a platform for Chinese-American scientists and physicians in the field of lung biology and respiratory medicine to advance research, patient care, education, and advocacy efforts.

We aim to promote collaborations and communications in pulmonary research within CALA members; cultivate the career development of junior CALA members; provide support to investigators with translational needs into drug development for pulmonary diseases; advocate for CALA faculty members and advance their career in pulmonary society.
