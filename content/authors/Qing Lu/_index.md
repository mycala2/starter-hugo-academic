**Associate Professor of Medicine, Alpert Medical School of Brown University**<br>
**Research Biologist, Providence VA Medical Center / Ocean State Research Institute**

**Research Interests : Acute respiratory destress syndrome (ARDS), Lung injury and repair, Lung inflammation and immunity**

Dr. Luâ€™s Lab is interested in understanding how external insults (e.g. cigarette smoke) and internal stress (e.g. adenosine) affect pulmonary endothelial cells and innate immunity and their roles in the development of pulmonary diseases (e.g. severe lung infections, ARDS, and COPD). Funded by NIH R01 and P20 awards, her current research is focused on understanding the effects and mechanisms of cigarette smoke predisposing patients/animals to severe lung injury and development of ARDS in response to a second insult by targeting pulmonary endothelial cells and alveolar macrophages.
