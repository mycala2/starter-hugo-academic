**Assistant Professor, Director of the Functional Genomics Laboratory**<br>
**Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School**

The central goal of Dr. Zhou’s research group is to decode the molecular mechanism by which genetic variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) determine disease susceptibility to asthma and COPD by using in vitroand in vivoapproaches. Funded by several NIH R01 or P01 grants, Dr. Zhou’s group has developed integrative approaches to identify regulatory DNA regions, localize functional variants, and evaluate the function of novel COPD GWAS genes in vitroand in vivoin conventional and conditional knockout mice. Dr. Zhou’s group also applied the CRSIRP/Cas-9 based genome editing in cellular models and disease relevant murine models to rapidly perform functional assessments on increasing number of COPD GWAS genes.
