**Assistant Professor of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Division of Biology and Medicine, Brown University**

**Research Interests : Fibrosis, COPD, Asthma, Lung Injury and Repair, Immunology**

My primary research interests are directed towards understanding the immunopathogenesis of lung injury and repair. I have interrogated the roles of adenosine signaling, EGFR signaling, and chitinase-like proteins and in a variety of lung diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary fibrosis. My future research plans are aimed at dissecting the common mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, specifically the role of intracellular receptor trafficking pathways in disease progress. My long-range research goals are to identify the immune and cellular responses that mediate lung injury and repair responses and to identify specific molecular targets that can be targeted in the treatment of related disorders.
