**Professor, Department of Medicine Pulmonary Division and the Womenâ€™s Guild Lung Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.**<br>
**Professor, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA**

**Research Interests : Lung fibrosis, IPF, alveolar epithelial cells, lung progenitor cells, fibroblast origin, fibroblast subsets, aging, metabolism, therapeutics**

The Jiang Laboratory has defined the roles of the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan and its receptors in regulating epithelial cell injury, progenitor cell regeneration, inflammation and fibrosis in response to non-infectious lung injury. We have a collection of human lung samples, developed strategies to isolate, purify, and culture primary lung epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells, and utilized these resources to generate single cell transcriptomes of lung epithelial cells and mesenchymal subpopulations. My lab has extensive experience in generating genetically modified mouse models and in delineating the mechanisms of lung injury, repair, and fibrosis. Ongoing projects include exploring the epithelial cell subtypes and fibroblast subtypes with single-cell RNA-sequencing, the role of lung progenitor cells in lung injury and repair, transcriptional regulation of lung fibrosis, as well as origin of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in lung fibrosis, with a focus on discovery and characterization of novel targets.
